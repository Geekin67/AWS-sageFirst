Having massive issues with getting amplify to work for me.  Even using cloud9 in AWS it is givving me a error of sync function run(argv) {
      ^^^^^^^^

SyntaxError: Unexpected token function

  I am sure someone else way have seen this I believe it is an issue from the evironment I am using is a live USB which has not been istalled with nor have I accessed the AWS CLI, even though I have keys, I have not been asked to provide them.
